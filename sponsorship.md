## About Buffalo Open Coffee Club (BOCC)

Buffalo Open Coffee Club (BOCC) is a free, weekly networking event for Buffalo’s small business and entrepreneurial community. Held every Tuesday morning from 7:30 AM to 9:00 AM in the lobby of [Seneca One Tower](https://senecaonebuffalo.com/), BOCC creates space for business owners, aspiring founders, and students to connect, collaborate, and grow.

The format is simple: open networking followed by a community “Gives and Asks” session. Attendees share what they need help with—or offer help to others. It’s a high-energy, no-frills, and impact-driven meetup that welcomes both first-timers and veteran entrepreneurs alike.

## Who Attends?

In 2024, BOCC averaged 32 attendees each week. The community is a diverse audience of small business owners, founders, freelancers, and students from [Buffalo State](https://suny.buffalostate.edu/), [Canisius University](https://www.canisius.edu/), and [University at Buffalo](https://www.buffalo.edu/). The population is an approximate 50:50 split of men and women. 

BOCC is often the first stop for those exploring Buffalo’s startup ecosystem. Many attendees form lasting relationships, launch projects together, and credit the club with helping them feel part of a real community.
