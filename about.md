Everything old is new again. Back in 2010, a small group (a packed morning was 10 people) of startup-interested folks used to gather for coffee on Tuesdays at Spot on Chippewa. It was the accidental founding of Buffalo's startup community. Prior to the pandemic - [Jack Greco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacklgreco/) and [Clark Dever](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clarkdever/) rebooted that concept and blew it up to 150 people a week. 

This post COVID incarnation of the group, organized by [Zack Glick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zglick/), is not exactly that group, but it is an attempt to gather the startup community under a chill spot to talk with the other members of the community, to encourage chasing the impossible, and to be there for the community.
