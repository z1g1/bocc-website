*Version 1.0 last updated 2024-04-19*

Buffalo Open Coffee Club is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for every participant, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or any other personal characteristics. We do not tolerate harassment of anyone in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for this venue, including Slack, and email. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the organization at the discretion of the organizers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, [please contact the organizers immediately](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfDqOoB3eLfUJe2bST_3hzpHFPNxR8zNRARXSpbpLkvJrjmyw/viewform?usp=header).
